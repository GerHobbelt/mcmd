################################### explanation ###
# ?a : It cannot assign the field if there are duplicat name of fields.
#  [how to] Specify a complete set of field names like 'mchkcsv a=x,y,z'
# ?b : MCMD has a valid set of charactors for a field name.
#  [how to]Specify a complete set of field names like 'mchkcsv a=x,y,z'
# ?c : MCMD can handle only lines with LF as a EOL.
#      This is MCMD original restriction, conforming to RFC4180.
#  [how to] Run mchkcsv command that convert CR,CRLF to LF.
#
# ?d : The last line does not have a EOL charactor.
#      It does not conform to RFC4180.
#  [how to] Run mchkcsv command add LF at the end.
#
# ?e : Data file has '\0' charactor.
#      The data may not be a text.
#      It does not conform to RFC4180.
#  [how to] Run mchkcsv that convert the charactor to "&#x00;".
#           Run mchkcsv command with '-r' option that delete '\0' characotr.
#
# ?f : The number of charactors per line exceed the limit MCMD can handle.
#      MCMD can handle a line less than or equal to 1024000 bytes of charactors.
#  [how to] Change a enviroment variable KG_MaxRecLen.
#        ex) export KG_MaxRecLen=2048000
#      You cannot specify the number greater than 10240000 bytes.
#      This is MCMD original restriction, conforming to RFC4180.
#
# ?g : MCMD can handle only a CSV data that all lines have same number of fields.
#      This is MCMD original restriction, conforming to RFC4180.
#  [how to]
#       1) Use mchkcsv command that aligns all lines with same number of the field name header.
#            Exceeded field value will be cut off, and it will add a NULL value for missing field.
#       2) Use mchkcsv command with a= parameter.
#            It uses the field names on a= parameter just as a header line (the header line will be skipped).
#
# ?h : Field value include a control charactors (0x01~0x1F,0x7F).
#      The data may not be a text.
#      It does not conform to RFC4180.
#  [how to] Run mchkcsv that convert the charactor to text like "&#x01;".
#           Run mchkcsv command with '-r' option that delete the control characotrs.
#
# ?i : TAB cannot be used.
#      It does not conform to RFC4180.
#  [how to] Run mchkcsv that convert the TAB to "&#x09;".
#           Run mchkcsv command with '-r' option that delete the TAB.
#
# ?j : Double quotation charactor is found in a value not enclosed by double quotation.
#        ex) NG: xxx,oo"oo,xxx  -> OK: xxx,"oo""oo",xxx
#      It does not conform to RFC4180.
#  [how to] Run mchkcsv that makes convertion in the above example.
#
# ?k : Double quotation charactor is found in a value enclosed by double quotation.
#      ex) NG: xxx,"oo"oo",xxx  -> OK: xxx,"oo""oo",xxx
#      It does not conform to RFC4180.
#  [how to] Run mchkcsv that makes convertion in the above example.
# ?l : It has BOM (Bite Order Mark) at the beginning of data.
#  [how to] Run mchkcsv command that remove the BOM.
